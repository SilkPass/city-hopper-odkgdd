The app will focus on location selection, prioritizing Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong based on the user's location, with a manual selection option.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Location Selection Screen:**\n    -   Implement a screen similar to the image, where the user can select their location.\n    -   Use the device's location services to determine the user's current location (ask for permission).\n    -   Based on the user's location, automatically suggest Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, sorted by distance.\n    -   Provide a manual location search option.\n    -   Display a map view (using `react-native-maps`) showing the selected location.\n-   **Services Screen:**\n    -   Include \"My Guide\", \"eSIM\", and \"Payment\" buttons, as shown in the image. These buttons can navigate to placeholder screens for now.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    -   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    -   Primary: `#4285F4` (Blue, similar to the \"My Guide\" button)\n    -   Secondary: `#66BB6A` (Green, similar to the \"eSIM\" button)\n    -   Accent: `#9C27B0` (Purple, similar to the \"Payment\" button)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    -   Highlight: `#FFEB3B` (Yellow)\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\".\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    -   Remove the `modalDemos` array.\n    -   Implement the location selection screen with automatic location detection and manual search.\n    -   Integrate `react-native-maps` to display the map.\n    -   Add the \"My Guide,\" \"eSIM,\" and \"Payment\" buttons, linking them to placeholder screens.\n2.  **Create Placeholder Screens:**\n    -   Create basic placeholder screens for \"My Guide,\" \"eSIM,\" and \"Payment\" in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n3.  **Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    -   Ensure the tab layout is consistent with the new screens.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-11T16:08:48.599465"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a location and services app similar to the iOS app in the image.
